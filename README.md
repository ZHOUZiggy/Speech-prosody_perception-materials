Perception Experiment Sound Files

Welcome to the repository for my perception experiment sound files. This project includes audio recordings of participants speaking the phrase "What a wonderful film" in both Mandarin and French.

Participants

For each language, there are recordings from three different participants. The participants have provided two types of utterances:

IC: Ironic Criticism
LP: Literal Praise
